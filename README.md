# yalecovid

> A Python program for parsing data from Yale's COVID-19 statistics webpages.

Use this program to download Yale's provided COVID-19 data in a more flexible format than a webpage. Graphs are saved as images and the online HTML tables are saved as CSV spreadsheets, which are easier to use programatically or for data processing applications.
